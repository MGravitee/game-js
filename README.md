Who's That Pokémon?!? is a browser-based, vanilla JavaScript, word guessing game similar to wheel of fortune (but without Pat Sajak or prizes) based on the popular Pokémon franchise (please don't sue me Nintendo).
Every word you need to guess is the name of one of the 150 (151 if we count Mew) first generation Pokémon. The object of the game is to guess as many as you can correctly within the time limit.

It was created using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript

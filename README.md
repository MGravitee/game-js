Who's That Pokémon?!? is a browser-based word guessing game similar to wheel of fortune (but without Pat Sajak or prizes) based on the popular Pokémon franchise (please don't sue me Nintendo). 

It was my first foray into the super fun world of vanilla JavaScript and I know if I come back and look at it months from now that I would likely change a lot.

Every word you need to guess is the name of one of the 150 (151 if we count Mew) first generation Pokémon. The object of the game is to guess as many as you can correctly within the time limit.
